---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Scripting is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

This module provides all the necessary tools to embed the V8 JavaScript Engine
(http://code.google.com/p/v8/) in Athena, and execute JavaScript commands.

This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
scripting solution instead, or to not use one at all.


---------------------------------------

---------------------------------------

Athena-Scripting requires the following dependencies:

   - XMake
   - Athena-Math
   - Athena-Core
   - V8
   - UnitTest++
   - rapidjson

They are provided as GIT submodules of this repository and will be compiled
automatically during the compilation of Athena-Scripting.

To download them, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Scripting>
    Athena-Scripting$ git submodule init
    Athena-Scripting$ git submodule update
